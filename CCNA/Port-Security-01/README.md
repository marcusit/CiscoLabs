# Equipment

* 1 Switch
* 3 Hosts

# Objective
1. Configure port security on the first switch port, hardcoding the MAC address of Host A. Plug in Host A and validate that it can ping Host B connected to the same switch.
2. Disconnect Host A and connect Host C to the first switch port. Try to ping Host B again, which should fail.
3. Re-connect Host A to the first swich port and make sure that Host A can ping Host B again.
