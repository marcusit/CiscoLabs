# Equipment

* 1 Switch
* 3 Hosts

# Objective
1. Configure port security on the first switch port, hardcoding the MAC address of host A. Plug in host A and validate that it can ping host B connected to the same switch.
2. Disconnect host A and connect host C. Try to ping again, which should fail.
3. Re-connect host A to the first swich port and make sure that host A can ping host B again.
