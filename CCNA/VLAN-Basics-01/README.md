# Equipment

* 1 Switch
* 3 Hosts

# Objective
1. Connect Host A, B and C to switch ports 1, 2 and 3. Make sure all hosts are able to ping eachother.
2. Assign host A and C to VLAN 100, named "Sales". Assign host B to VLAN 200, names "Marketing".
3. Validate that hosts in VLAN 100 can no longer ping Host B, but can ping eachother.
4. Validate on the switch that the VLANs were created and that the appropriate ports were assigned.
5. Create a new VLAN 500 named "NULL". Assign all unused switch ports to this VLAN.
