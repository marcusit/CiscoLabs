# Equipment

* 1 Switch (layer 3)
* 2 Hosts

# Objective
1. Connect Host A to Switch 1 port 1, and Host B to Switch 1 port 2. Set the default gateway on each host to the first IP address in their respective subnets.
2. In not already functional, enable layer 3 routing on Switch 1.
3. Create VLANs 30 and 50 on Switch 1. Assign port 1 to VLAN 30 and port 2 to VLAN 50 on Switch 1.
4. Configure routing on Switch 1 so that the subnets in VLAN 30 and 50 can communicate.
5. Validate the configuration by pinging Host B from Host A.
